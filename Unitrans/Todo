High
======

Lower
=====
• Remove primaryTrips from code
• Create separate arrival/Departure stops for the Silo (like the MU)
• Show prediction times in accessory popup view when user taps a stop
• Don't remove pins when changing patterns, instead just update pin images
• Make pin for selected stops also "hidden" when necessary

Secondary
=========

• At a given stop for a given route also show other arrival times for other routes.
• SMS Alerts
• Find nearest stops and distances to other stops
• Show if buses are late or on time or early
  - In StopTimes view we can show this with a simple left aligned image
  - In mapview we can show this by color coding the buses?
• Animate buses
• Some sort of indicator to show the direction of the route on the map
• Shake to go to home view (routes view)?

• W Line not deselecting (perhaps the animation of the toolbar off the screen does something? Yes the tableView is resized and 
  the deselect is called in viewWillAppear: in UITableViewController so for some reason the cell is not deselected (bug in UIKit??)

• Have all StopViewControllers reload their tables (to update expired cells) when the app becomes active again.
• Animate insertion/removal of expired times?• Zoom button should include user's location if available.
