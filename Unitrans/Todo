Priority
========
• Display prediction times
• Set maximum and minimum dates for date picker
• Retrieval of predictions and bus info should be in seperate thread.
• Organize stops better: separate inbound/outbound sections?
• At a given stop for a given route also show other arrival times for other routes.
• Process stops and remove street title and move bound direction to a seperate property (eg remove st, blvd, and move (WB) to separate property)
• Split times into Night and Day segments in StopTimes view
• Handle errors: can't load predictions, can't load core data file etc
• MapView button disclosure triangle should also go to maps.
• Indicator when buses are currently updating.
• Network indicator when we gather data from the internet.
• Decide whether to move "Show in Map" button to a toolbar icon button or move the toolbar "Map" button to a "Show in Map" button.
• Date picker says Today and Yesterday for today and yesterday dates
• Date picker has weekday name
• Date picker has longer more natural height

Secondary
=========
• Left-aligned images for routes table.
• Bus images also take into account heading direction.
• SMS Alerts
• Find nearest stops and distances to other stops
• Show if buses are late or on time or early
  - In StopTimes view we can show this with a simple left aligned image
  - In mapview we can show this by color coding the buses?
• Animate buses
• In RouteView have list of recently chosen stops before list of all stops
• Derive "patterns" from GTFS
• Fix annotation view drawing order so that route lies at bottom, buses over the route, and stops over route, and stop description bubbles on top.
• Display list of patterns to choose from in map view.

Done
=========
• Add NSDate category to output beginning of day
• Fix datepicker so that it doesn't set current time when setting current date.
• About/Info view
• When processing GTFS files, remove routes with no trips (eg N)
• Implement PredictionManager
• Change titles of ViewControllers to be more descriptive
• Show expired stop times
• Handle errors: Can't load map, can't load bus locations
• Show mapview button for StopTimesView and select stop in mapview
