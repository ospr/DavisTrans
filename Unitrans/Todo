Secondary
=========
• Bus images also take into account heading direction.
• SMS Alerts

• Show if buses are late or on time or early
  - In StopTimes view we can show this with a simple left aligned image
  - In mapview we can show this by color coding the buses?
• Animate buses
• In RouteView have list of recently chosen stops before list of all stops
• Derive "patterns" from GTFS
• Display list of patterns to choose from in map view.
• Some sort of indicator to show the direction of the route on the map
• Date picker has weekday name

Done
=========
• Add NSDate category to output beginning of day

• Animate stop pins
• Activity indicator when buses are currently updating.
• Date picker has weekday name

• Process stops and remove street title and move bound direction to a seperate property (eg remove st, blvd, and move (WB) to separate property) (kip)
• Derive primary trip (based on shapes) for a route in database manager and use that as the mapview route (kip)
