Lower

Secondary
=========
• Left-aligned images for routes table.
• Bus images also take into account heading direction.
• SMS Alerts
• Find nearest stops and distances to other stops
• Show if buses are late or on time or early
  - In StopTimes view we can show this with a simple left aligned image
  - In mapview we can show this by color coding the buses?
• Animate buses
• In RouteView have list of recently chosen stops before list of all stops
• Derive "patterns" from GTFS
• Fix annotation view drawing order so that route lies at bottom, buses over the route, and stops over route, and stop description bubbles on top.
• Display list of patterns to choose from in map view.
• Some sort of indicator to show the direction of the route on the map

• Animate stop pins
• Activity indicator when buses are currently updating.
