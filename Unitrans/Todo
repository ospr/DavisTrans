Priority
========
• Implement PredictionManager
• Display prediction times
• Implement TableView methods for StopTimeViewController
• Change titles of ViewControllers to be more descriptive
• Set maximum and minimum dates for date picker
• Fix annotation view drawing order so that route lies at bottom, buses over the route, and stops on top.
• Derive "patterns" from GTFS
• Display list of patterns to choose from in map view.
• Retrieval of predictions and bus info should be in seperate thread.
• Organize stops better: separate inbound/outbound sections?
• At a given stop for a given route also show other arrival times for other routes.


Secondary
=========
• Left-aligned images for routes table.
• Bus images also take into account heading direction.
• SMS Alerts
• Find nearest stops and distances to other stops
• Show if buses are late or on time or early
  - In StopTimes view we can show this with a simple left aligned image
  - In mapview we can show this by color coding the buses?
• Show expired stop times
• Animate buses

Done
=========
• Add NSDate category to output beginning of day
• Fix datepicker so that it doesn't set current time when setting current date.
• About/Info view
• When processing GTFS files, remove routes with no trips (eg N)
